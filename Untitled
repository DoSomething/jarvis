RECODE

- cleaner tests, dont leave anything out, dont cover "schemas"
- no flows
- no messages on Node. Bare node is just "Title" and "Hop" fields. run() function returns the message to send.
- better file organization re: nodes, loading (remove ../../)
- think about versioning, archiving, etc
- start with images as well, don't skip around it
- lets handle promises by default, no bluebird hack
- lets do the sharding on messages
- lets get some business functionality as well
